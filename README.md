# Component Networks

Library &amp; tools based on concept graphs to
* define components and networks thereof
* derive more specialized subdomains e.g. processor networks

Starting from the common concept graphs defined in the hypergraph library
the concepts of
* components
* interfaces
* networks
are introduced.
Having these classes, a vast amount of more specific models can be embedded into either of the introduced classes.
These models can encode e.g. task networks, processor networks and other domains.
