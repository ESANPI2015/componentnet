# Domain Specific Graphs

Library &amp; tools based on concept graphs to
* define domains which contain subsets of concepts and relations belonging to them
* define the domain of components with interfaces
* define the domain of component networks

Starting from the common concept graphs defined in the hypergraph library
the domain concept is introduced (see DomainSpecificGraph class).
From this the first domain, the domain of component and component networks is introduced (see ComponentNetworks class).
Having these classes, a vast amount of more specific models can be embedded into either of the introduced classes.
